        <title>TechnodeFirmaCraft Changelog</title>
      </page_title>
          <p>Welcome to the latest beta release of TechnodeFirmaCraft for MC 1.12.2</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p space="10" />
          <p>A lot of work has got us to this point, but there is a lot of work left to go. At this point we need your assistance to get us the polish and shine that TNFC was known for.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>TFC-NG or TNG has brought the vast majority of the TFC systems to 1.12.2. Some got left behind but overall the mod is very slick and well put together.</p>  
          <p space="10" />
          <p>We've added some new mods, some familiar mods from 1.7.10 and hope to get them all working together to provide a long and interesting experience from Stone Age to the beyond.</p>
          
          <p>As it stands now:</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>The basic set of mods are in place. The core oregen should be in place. This means that worlds should be stable as we update the other bits.</p> 
          <p space="10" />
          <p>The other bits will be scripty stuff to integrate mods in, change recipes, change machine mechanics and config changes to balance things out.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>We can't promise a no-restart-ever future for TNFC but I believe it's pretty stable and you should be able to continue with a world along many TNFC updates.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>The progression path is similar to 1.7.10 TNFC.</p>
          <p>The core initial gameplay is very much the TFC experience. You will need to progress with TFC to at least the Iron Age before the features and benefits (and jetpacks) in TNFC start to become feasible.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>The BetterWithMods, Astikorcarts and HorsePower mods allow some early automation and are worth exploring. Once solidly into Iron, Immersive Engineering will open up. Most of it will be gated by steel, so it's wise to continue along the TFC progression (ideally all the way to coloured steels). Immersive Engineering and Petroleum will open up a lot of options.</p>
          <p>PneumaticCraft and Rockhounding open up all sorts of options. Leading finally to  </p>
          <p>Advanced Rocketry! The moons and planets yield many things, including The End, which is a moon around another planet you'll have to find.</p>
          <p>So tech up, get to The End, kill the Dragon and craft the ultimate prize from it's Egg!</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>We think we like the various settings and recipes, lot's of work has gone into balancing and setup.</p>
          <p>But this is where you come in. We need you to let us know about all the issues. Something exploitable, or impossible, or just excessively expensive?</p>
          <p>Need to know where we need to continue to polish things.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>Also, the IE hemp seeds no longer come from zombies. Instead, if you want Hemp you gotta get high. If that's not enough of a clue, use a knife or a scythe on grass at heights greater than 170. It's a rare drop. </p>
          
          <p space="10" />
          <p>The Issues link on the Main Page will take you to the Github repo for pack. Where we're going to corral and work the issues.</p>
          <p>Get your issues in. Suggestions, ideas, and requests are all good too.</p>

        <title>TechnodeFirmaCraft Tips and Tricks</title>
      </page_title>
          <p>Things to be aware of in TechnodeFirmaCraft for MC 1.12.2</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p space="10" />
          <p>Putting hot things (ingots, sheets, tools) into wooden (chests) or leather (backpack) containers will cause the container to catch on fire. You've been warned</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>The IE hemp seeds no longer come from zombies. Instead, if you want Hemp you gotta get high. If that's not enough of a clue, use a knife or a scythe on grass at heights greater than 170. It's a rare drop. </p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>Being in the dark without a light source will lead to Gloom, Blindness or even the Grue! Carry a torch in your offhand to light up those areas as you explore</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>Walking in grass slows you down. Make paths with shovels, or the Plow Cart to speed your travels.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>Cold is a killer. You can use straw in your inventory to stay warm in exchange for inventory space. Each slot occupied provides some warmth.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>Heat is a killer. You can use ice or snow blocks in your inventory to stay cool in exchange for inventory space. Each slot occupied provides some warmth.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>Heat is a killer. Wear a hat. You can craft a simple Nifty Straw Hat from straw to keep the rays off your melon.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>Cold is a killer. Wear armour. The leather and metal armours provide increasing levels of cold protection. Exception being Black Bronze and Red Steel</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>Heat is a killer. Wear armour. Black Bronze and Red Steel armours provide protection against heat... because reasons.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>Heat is a killer. The Forge is very hot. You can convert a Leather Tunic into a Leather Forging Bib by soaking it in limewater. Worn in Baubles slot it prevents Forge heat.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>Temperature in general. Stay hydrated. Stay well fed. Meat and dairy in the cold. Fruit and veg in the heat. Stay in the shade. Build enclosed, lit spaces for comfort.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>There are hint rocks for the minerals that don't have surface ores. If you see a rock on the surface out of place for the surrounding rock type, it's a clue to something underneath.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>You can make a boat with an alternative recipe not requiring a saw, great for early exploration!</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>The mod mineral tracker is integrated with JourneyMap. Switch to topographic view to see any surface ores you've picked up.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>Alternate paper making recipes. Sawdust from BwM saws. Woodpulp from sawdust and vinegar in barrel. Press wood pulp to make paper.</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>When you make a space station, make copies of the station id chip. If you for some reason lose your only chip and can't get back to the station with a space elevator, the station is lost</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>Placing a ladder on every second block works perfectly fine and is a good way to save ladders</p>
          <p space="10" />
          <p>The IE Electric Lights and Electric Heater are great ways to automate heat in the winter</p>
          <p space="10" />
