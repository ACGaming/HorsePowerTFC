      <p>Welcome to the latest beta release of TechnodeFirmaCraft for MC 1.12.2</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>A lot of work has got us to this point, but there is always work left to do. We always need your assistance to get us the polish and shine that TNFC was known for.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>TFC-NG or TNG has brought the vast majority of the TFC systems to 1.12.2. <link href="https://tng.terrafirmacraft.com/Differences_From_Classic">Some got left behind </link> but overall the mod is very slick and well put together.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>We've added some new mods, some familiar mods from 1.7.10 and mostly have them all working together to provide a long and interesting experience from Stone Age to the beyond.</p>

      <p>As it stands now:</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The basic set of mods are in place. The core oregen should be in place. This means that worlds should be stable as we update the other bits.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The other bits will be scripty stuff to integrate mods in, change recipes, change machine mechanics and config changes to balance things out.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>We can't promise a no-restart-ever future for TNFC but I believe it's pretty stable and you should be able to continue with a world along many TNFC updates.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The progression path is similar to 1.7.10 TNFC.</p>
      <p>The core initial gameplay is very much the TFC experience. You will need to progress with TFC to at least the Iron Age before the features and benefits (and jetpacks) in TNFC start to become feasible.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The BetterWithMods, Astikorcarts and HorsePower mods allow some early automation and are worth exploring. Once solidly into Iron, Immersive Engineering will open up. Most of it will be gated by steel, so it's wise to continue along the TFC progression (ideally all the way to coloured steels). Immersive Engineering and Petroleum will open up a lot of options.</p>
      <p>PneumaticCraft and Rockhounding open up all sorts of options. Leading finally to</p>
      <p>Advanced Rocketry! The moons and planets yield many things, including The End, which is a moon around another planet you'll have to find.</p>
      <p>So tech up, get to The End, kill the Dragon and craft the ultimate prize from it's Egg!</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>We think we like the various settings and recipes, lot's of work has gone into balancing and setup.</p>
      <p>But this is where you come in. We need you to let us know about all the issues. Something exploitable, or impossible, or just excessively expensive?</p>
      <p>Need to know where we need to continue to polish things.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Also, the IE hemp seeds no longer come from zombies. Instead, if you want Hemp you gotta get high. If that's not enough of a clue, use a knife or a scythe on grass at heights greater than 170. It's a rare drop.</p>

      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The Issues link on the Main Page will take you to the Github repo for pack. Where we're going to corral and work the issues.</p>
      <p>Get your issues in. Suggestions, ideas, and requests are all good too.</p>

      <p space="10"/>
      <p italics="true">Things to be aware of in TechnodeFirmaCraft for MC 1.12.2</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Putting hot things (ingots, sheets, tools) into wooden (chests) or leather (backpack) containers will cause the container to catch on fire. You've been warned</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The IE hemp seeds no longer come from zombies. Instead, if you want Hemp you gotta get high. If that's not enough of a clue, use a knife or a scythe on grass at heights greater than 170. It's a rare drop.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Being in the dark without a light source will lead to Gloom, Blindness or even the Grue! Carry a torch in your offhand to light up those areas as you explore</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Walking in grass slows you down. Make paths with shovels, or the Plow Cart to speed your travels. Spending time in a chunk accumulates 'Spawn Protection'. Once a chunk is protected, the grass will no longer grow high.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Cold is a killer. You can use straw in your inventory to stay warm in exchange for inventory space. Each slot occupied provides some warmth.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Heat is a killer. You can use ice or snow blocks in your inventory to stay cool in exchange for inventory space. Each slot occupied provides some warmth.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Heat is a killer. Wear a hat. You can craft a simple Nifty Straw Hat from straw to keep the rays off your melon.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Cold is a killer. Wear armour. The leather and metal armours provide increasing levels of cold protection. Exception being Black Bronze and Red Steel</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Heat is a killer. Wear armour. Black Bronze and Red Steel armours provide protection against heat... because reasons.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Heat is a killer. The Forge is very hot. You can convert a Leather Tunic into a Leather Forging Bib by soaking it in limewater. Worn in Baubles slot it prevents Forge heat.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Temperature in general. Stay hydrated. Stay well fed. Meat and dairy in the cold. Fruit and veg in the heat. Stay in the shade. Build enclosed, lit spaces for comfort.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>There are hint rocks for the minerals that don't have surface ores. If you see a rock on the surface out of place for the surrounding rock type, it's a clue to something underneath.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>You can make a boat with an alternative recipe not requiring a saw, great for early exploration!</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The mod mineral tracker is integrated with JourneyMap. Switch to topographic view to see any surface ores you've picked up.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Alternate paper making recipes. Sawdust from BwM saws. Woodpulp from sawdust and vinegar in barrel. Press wood pulp to make paper.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Placing a ladder on every second block works perfectly fine and is a good way to save ladders</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Stuck in the rain? Fire not starting? throw some straw down, make sure you have a log and three sticks, and hide under a tree so you're not directly under the rain.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Don't swim in the ocean at night. you will freeze.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Crops and fruit trees are very particular about growing conditions. Rainfall and temp both apply to whether a crop or fruit tree will grow.</p>
      <p>This <link href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ghw3dCmVO5Gv0MMGBydUxox_nwLYmmcZkGSbbf0QSAE/edit#gid=37622487">spreadsheet</link> will provide all the details about crops and fruit trees and the conditions they require.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The IE Electric Lights and Electric Heater are great ways to automate heat in the winter</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The IE Excavator does not like to touch TFC blocks (including snow!). When you build the Excavator, remove all blocks within 2 of the Excavator's bucket wheel (including the sides). Also put a roof over the top (with a 2 space gap) to prevent snow from accumulating on the wheel. Failure to do so will crash your game or server.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The IE Mining Drill has a bug with falling blocks. When using the Drill to mine, only drill when no blocks will fall. Either by drilling straight down, or by only drilling in areas with supports. Failure to do so will crash your server/game.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>When you make a space station, make copies of the station id chip. If you for some reason lose your only chip and can't get back to the station with a space elevator, the station is lost</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>If you're having timeout issues connecting to a TNFC server, or sometimes even loading a save in single player.</p>
      <p>Add this parameter to the startup for the server:</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p bold = "true">-Dfml.readTimeout=512</p>
      <p>Or even to the java parameters for the client.</p>
      <p space="10"/>

      <p bold="true">Biletooth's TNFC Progression</p>
      <p space="2"/>
      <link ref="index" color="#CC3333">&lt;- Index</link>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p italics="true">TNFC is rather daunting with many ways to progress. To get you started, <link href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Technode/comments/icjt8r/technodefirmacraft_progression/">Biletooth chronicles</link> how he progressed through TNFC.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Note that this is just my way of progressing and I highly recommend you carve your own path. There is no guide for TNFC but by combining the information pinned in the TNFC discord channels and using JEI you should be able to figure everything out. TNFC works with TFC 1.12 now, there is many changes from classic and I recommend looking at the 1.12 changes wiki page to clarify this.
        <link href="https://tng.terrafirmacraft.com/Differences_From_Classic">TFC Differences from Classic</link>
      </p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>For the TFC part there is also a well implemented Patchouli book available. Finally I recommend taking a look at the modlist of TNFC and searching in JEI with @[modname] to see what the mod has to offer and go from there. Some general tips include: looking up what kind of rare resources you need for certain mods (like redstone, lapiz, glowstone or even nickel for black steel etc.) and only start progressing in those mods when you know you have access to them. In that regard I also highly recommend playing on a server so you can trade for resources if you don’t find them. Tool progression is very important in this pack, different tiers of Hammers/chisels/saws WILL unlock different recipes. The higher tier machines won’t be craftable with a low tier tool.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Now onto my actual progression.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>It all starts with base TFC. Again this is totally up to you how you progress through TFC. I made the 'challenge' for myself to not look at better ways of getting steel before I had made a full, max capacity TFC blast furnace for example. If you're new to TFC or new to TFC 1.12 I recommend reading through the new manual for it. I personally spend the first in game year exploring for several key resources and a base location.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The first venture into mods other than TFC started for me after steel. At this point you can start making Yabba barrels and organise your storage better. I also started to look at some BmW features like the windmill for a saw and a grindstone and a bit later I decided to look at the Horsepower horse press and horse grindstone. After that I progress my way up to black steel. When reaching black steel tier, and more specifically a black steel hammer and chisel, I looked at Immersive Engineering. Getting the metal press is a huge quality of life upgrade from base TFC and I recommend getting it early. When the age of IE starts there's lots to do. There’s several energy generating options where I started with windmills and waterwheels. When I had a basic power setup I looked at the Electric crucible and Electric forge which again are a massive Quality of Life item. The vanilla steel furnace and IE Crusher is also on this list.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Somewhere around this time I teched up further to red/blue steel tier and made the appropriate anvil, tools and buckets. Then I tried out the diesel generator with an IE refinery and pump jack when I had a steady supply of diesel I made an excavator and spend the next couple of in game days scouting for deposits and harvesting them. To conclude the energy track I constructed a steam turbine with solar towers. There’s also the furnace track in IE which starts with the coke oven and crude blast furnace and eventually ends in the Arc furnace. There's lots of other stuff in IE which I haven't done yet or that I could have done earlier, again here, take a look at what the mod has to offer and what you want to focus on, IE also has a great in game manual. I "ended" Immersive Engineering by making the mining drill, 3 excavators and another pump jack not connected to the refinery for raw oil. The whole systems runs on a steam turbine with 4 solar towers and 2 steel tanks that store excess steam to get through the night. It generates 12k rf/t which I split into 2x6k lines, 1 line for 1 excavator an Arc furnace and misc machines (connected to a big capacitor battery and not using everything at the same time). The other 6k lines goes to the two other excavators and an RF flux generator.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>This flux generator leads me to the next mod I looked at, Pneumaticcraft. This was the first time I ever played with PnC and I loved every second of it. I highly recommend checking out its guidebook and the YouTube videos of Danny and Son. To get the flux generator you basically have to progress through the whole mod. Starting with getting the pressure chamber, oil refinery, plastic maker and the machines that make the circuit board. You will need advanced pressure to complete this track. Once I had the right infrastructure for it I created several of its nifty items like the Amadron tablet, omnidirectional hoppers, logistics drones (a whole topic on its own, great for storage) and finally I spend a lot of time on making the PNC armor and it's upgrades. I also tried out the pneumatic elevator to reach a place 40 blocks up, it’s not the greatest lift tbh but it is very immersive and I quite enjoy using it. The PNC track got concluded for me after making the upgraded armor set and crafting the Ariel interface (note you will have to go to the nether for this). Many things require plastic so this is a mod I frequently return to. Again check JEI and its manual to see all the stuff it has to offer, I probably missed most of it!</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>We’re coming up to the point where I currently am. I was debating between checking out RH and AR and went with the latter. AR has a very unique progression imo but it’s not well documented. There is a great video series on YouTube by Thorgal Daily Gaming where I got all my knowledge from, there’s also a wiki. At this point I made all the multiblock structures needed to make space infrastructure. I haven't yet build a rocket or the machines to fuelling it. I have however been to space as I play on the server and I 'bought' a subscription from another player where he build me a space elevator at my base and I pay him for using it to get access to space. I did notice you could build the 'lathe' from AR a lot earlier in this pack as it automates the making of rods (needed for rails and pistons) so you could make it a lot earlier if you wanted to automate this. AR progression is the only way to reach the End! So if you need stuff from the End this is the way.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>So that leaves me with the mods I haven't touched yet and there’s quite a lot of them that I could have already started and could have sped up my progress in other paths but such is the way of the sandbox. In particular XNet’s cable system seems to be very powerful but I have yet to explore it. RH has a whole progression path I still have to look at as well. That concludes my main tech progression so far.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>There’s several smaller mods that can aid you with several mods or that give a huge quality of life upgrade. The ones I've tested in this are: Wearable Backpacks, Waterflasks (recommend teching up to flask asap), a fishing rod for early food (tweaked recipe, use JEI), some BmW stuff, Waystone teleporting and some chisel and bits. There’s several smaller mods that I don’t know or haven’t used like Advanced Hook Launchers, AstikorCarts (great for animals and path making), First Aid bandages (I use hot spring healing and avoiding combat ;^) ), Immersive Cables, Just a Few Fish, Animal nets, OpenBlocks stuff and Simply Jetpacks.</p>

      <p bold="true">Rockhounding Tips by Benanov</p>
      <link ref="index" color="#CC3333">&lt;- Index</link>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p italics="true">Rockhounding is rather complicated. To get you started, here are some <link href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Technode/comments/jne6d2/benanovs_rockhounding_chemistry_tips">starting tips</link> starting tips from our resident RH expert.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Expect to need to stockpile a lot of resources to get a meaningful operation off the ground. Save those Uninspected Minerals!</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Mineral Sizer requires fuel (Syngas). Lava will work but honestly you want Syngas.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Flue Gas won't work, but considering I use the same setup is to make Flue Gas and Syngas. The RH setup machine guide has a small annotation about whether a machine requires RF or Fuel.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Fun fact: The Electrochemical CSTR requires both for all recipes in the TNFC pack</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The orientation of machines does matter in RH. If there's a blue arrow or orange arrow you need to make sure you're facing the correct way when placing the block.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>And servers are generally not required for machines, as far as i can tell. The Chemical Extractor and Mineral Sizer run fine without them. Servers are great for "do this X number of times" jobs - which is why I use it for the Metal Alloyer (otherwise it'll convert all of my element cabinet contents to White Gold or something).</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>IMO the Syngas setup is the first thing you should build in RH. Don't start chasing shards until you have a Gas Holder (not a mere pressure vessel) with at least a pixel of Syngas. (When you see how much Gas Holders hold, you'll understand.)</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p italics="true">A Note about Salt</p>
      <p>Salt is a valuable material in TechNode. You can use it to preserve food and it is an absolutely essential ingredient for two very important liquids in the Rockhounding Mineral cycle - Hydrochloric Acid and Sodium Cyanide. While you can also use salt to create Salt Water, this is generally not necessary.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>If you live in Rock Salt or have it nearby, great! If not you will need to spend some time making the Rockhounding Evaporation Tank and the Seasoning Rack. You will not be able to meaningfully do this until you can work Wrought Iron into ingots.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The Rockhounding Evaporation Tank has many modes, accessible with the Mod Wrench. For making salt, you do not need the wrench. (You will require one later to make Evaporation Tanks export Saturated Brine, an ingredient for Sodium Hydroxide.)</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>The Profiling Bench is required to make almost every other machine, and will be one of the first things you create. It does not require power to run. To change modes, punch it. To use it, place an item into it with right-click. To extract the product, right-click again.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p italics="true">A note about Sulfur</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Sulfur is a common extract from a lot of shards and relatively easy to select for even without filter upgrades, but until you start pulling sulfur out of your chemical extractor, you're going to want a few stacks of the yellow stinky stuff.</p>
      <p>If you can't find any, turn Bituminous Coal into Syngas and check your Particulate Collectors.</p>
      <p>Another option for obtaining Sulfur is recycling Toxic Waste. You can use an existing Syngas setup but you'll want a separate output vessel for the Flue Gas.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>A word of warning: Do not fill your cistern to capacity with Toxic Waste! Process it a few buckets at a time.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p italics="true">My Machine Isn't Processing!</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Many different parts of a machine require consumables. Common things to check besides power source are Slurry Agitators, Crushing Gears, Test Tubes, Graduated Cylinders, and Catalysts. All liquids and gases must be present in order for a machine to run.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>If your machine is running but keeps resetting its progress halfway through, you're out of power. Machines that require RF can have their power source upgraded with a Gas Turbine to burn Syngas to generate RF. (We have not found this to be a good method for generating RF to run the rest of your base.)</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p italics="true">What is that Explosion?</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Pressure Vessels only hold 1,000 Cu (the equivalent of 1,000 mB) of gas. This is a surprisingly small amount. Consider upgrading to a Gas Holder, or shut off the input to that Pressure Vessel and dump the contents.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p italics="true">There's Green Stuff all Over my Base!</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Congratulations, you've had your first industrial accident. Don't store pollutant fluids in Rockhounding tanks for any long period of time and do not allow a tank to be filled to capacity. With pollutant gases you have fewer options.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>PneumaticCraft Liquid Hoppers are incredibly useful for this purpose.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>I have found that the Lab Oven's Fluid Output system requires all of the Product to be drained before the Waste will export. If your output systems are not fast enough at picking up the Product, the Toxic Waste will build up and leak all over your lab.</p>

      <p bold="true">Finding a Decent TFC Seed</p>
      <link ref="index" color="#CC3333">&lt;- Index</link>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p><link href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Technode/comments/i6juqe/how_to_find_a_good_tfc_seed/">Original Reddit Article</link></p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Probably one of the most requested and source of most complaints in early TFC/TNFC (my Modpack that extends TFC) is finding the resources one needs to progress. As this is a much more involved, complicated and possibly time-consuming process, I thought I'd go over my own process for finding what I consider a good seed for our server and share it.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>For simplicity sake I'll refer to TFC, the advice I provide will also apply to Technodefirmacraft, wherever there are specific differences applicable only to the modpack, I will try and indicate. Otherwise, the advice is pretty universal to TFC Minecraft. Also note that all my advice is somewhat more specifically tied to the 1.12.2 TFC-NG versions. Although the general advice will of course be applicable to older TFC versions.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p italics="true">Step 1 - Know the Problem -</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>First, the background. TFC as a complete Minecraft makeover mod, changes the way the worldgen works to such a large extend that it's helpful to just forget everything you know about choosing a good Minecraft map. The key to progression in TFC is understanding rock types.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Rather than Minecraft's 'Stone', in TFC you have 22 different types of rock. These are divided into 4 types of rock (Sedimentary, Metamorphic, Igneous Extrusive and Igneous Intrusive). The rocks are world generated in 3 layers. All 22 rock types can appear at the top layer, but in the 2 deeper layers, only some of them will be used. The ores (copper, bismuth, tin, kaolinite, etc) will only spawn in certain rock types (eg. Cassiterite/Tin is only found Igneous Intrusive rock) or even in one particular rock (eg. Garnierite/Nickel ONLY spawns in Gabbro rock).</p>
      <p space="10"/><p>In addition, certain rocks perform additional functions. The first anvil you need comes from raw stone, and only from the Igneous Intrusive or Igneous Extrusive rock types, which contain 7 kinds of rock in them in total. The second and probably the most common source of early game frustration, is the flux rocks. Flux is used in the anvil to weld metals together. This is a key progression requirement. Only 4 rocks can be crushed to create flux (Chalk, Dolomite, Limestone and Marble). There is also a mineral that TFC generates (Borax) which can be used as flux, but it ONLY generates in rocksalt. Rocksalt itself is a special rock case, as it is the only source for salt, which can be used to preserve meat.</p>
      <p>The other issue that frequently catches players new to TFC out is the size of these rock biomes (I will refer to areas that a rock spawns at the top layer as a biome for convenience. These are not regular Minecraft or TFC 'biomes', do not appear differently in the F3 Debug overlay but when the world is generated, different rock types are selected for the top, middle and bottom layers. For convenience I will refer to the various rocks generated on the top layer as Rock Biomes). Rock biomes in TFC can be rather massive, it is not uncommon to walk 6000 blocks and see the same top layer rocks and soil for the entire journey. Travel and exploration is a key element to TFC so expect to do extensive walking or boating, but it can be frustrating walking 50-60 thousand blocks to find flux rock needed to progress out of the stone age. Hence this long screed.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>So you need certain rocks, and particularly in the early game you need them at the top layer, as exploiting resources in the deeper layer is far more difficult and a discussion for another tutorial. For this one, we need to decide, what are the rocks we need reasonably adjacent to our spawn in order to have a reasonable chance of progression. This is a matter of opinion and also changes dependent on whether you are playing just TFC itself or within a modpack such as Technodefirmacraft (TNFC) as modpacks will have additional ores and further will utilize more of the ores in TFC that are sometimes of limited import.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p italics="true">Step 2 - Define the requirements -</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>In my opinion, the rocks you need within a reasonable starting area (see note on walking above, for me a reasonable starting area is roughly 5000 chunks of spawn... do the math, it's a big area) are: a flux stone, a stone for the first anvil, a source of the key basic ores (copper, zinc, bismuth, tin, gold, silver, etc). And the key rocks for one off resources, gabbro (garnierite/nickel), marble lapis lazuli (probably more applicable to modpacks), rock salt for food preservation.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>So my basic must-have list is: gabbro for garnierite and kimberlite, marble for flux stone, graphite malachite and lapis, rocksalt for salt, kaolinite and coal ores, granite for tin, gold, silver and cryolite, a Igneous Extrusive rock (Andesite, Basalt, Dacite, Rhyolite) for bismuth, hematite, copper and gold. So that's at least 5 rocks you want within a reasonable area to progress. Again this a matter of opinion and depends on the other mods you're playing. But if you have these 5 rocks then you can get through the tech tree.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p italics="true">Step 3 - A better solution -</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>How to then ensure you have these 5 rock types within a particular minecraft seed? One method of course is to start map after map and either creative mode fly around or some other manual method to check what spawn rock biome and adjacent rock biomes you have available. This is slow and uncertain. A better method is to use Dries007 TFCSeedMaker to generate world candidates to choose from.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>There are two updated version of Dries007 TFCSeedmaker to choose from. I updated the original 1.7.10 version of Seedmaker to the 1.12.2 TFC-NG version <link href="https://github.com/AnodeCathode/TFCSeedMaker/releases/tag/1.0">myself</link>. Dries himself <link href="https://github.com/dries007/TFCSeedMaker/releases/tag/v0.2.0">updated</link> TFCSeedmaker to 1.12.2. I recommend my hacky update because of one key feature. Dries removed the summary file output from his updated Seedmaker. To me, the summary file is the most useful and valuable part of TFCSeedmaker. Also note that he changed the colours used to indicated different rock biomes, so the different graphic files created are not comparable. For this I will be assuming use of my version.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>TFCSeedmaker works stand-alone. It is not a Minecraft mod. It is a java utility that incorporates enough of the TFC world generation logic to create a simulation of the TFC world and then output graphics and a files detailing the world. Download TFCSeedMaker, put it into a new folder alone. Then you need to create a batch/cmd file to actually run the seedmaker and provide it with parameters. While your details may differ, the basic command I use to generate candidates is this:</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>java -jar TFCSeedMaker-0.1.0.jar -m all -r 5000 -n 10</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>This will create 10 map seed candidates, 5000 chunks out (not exactly Minecraft chunks, but I've decided 5000 is within my definition of 'reasonable').</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>So with a command/batch file and the jar, you launch TFCSeedmaker and it will create 10 sub folders, each named for the seed being tested. Depending on the size of the map (the -r 5000 parameter) and the power of your machine, it will take some time for TFCSeedmaker to generate all the candidates. Go have a coffee and watch something on TV. Seedmaker needs all the cores on your computer so leave it alone.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p italics="true">Step 4 - Process the Results -</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Once it completes, you will have 10 folders of candidates. Now you have to decide. My process is as follows, I go into each folder and open the summary file ({seednumber}.json). I look for the 5 key rock types listed above in the "rocksTop" section. I try not to look too closely and precisely where each rock type is, particularly if this is a map seed I'm going to play on myself. More looking at the general layout, and availability of the rock biomes. If I'm setting up a server I might be even more particular and count the total number of rocks in that section. TFC has 22 rocks in total and for a server I might keep looking until I find a seed with all 22 within the scan area.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>My second criteria is world layout. As is clear, travel around to get to the different rock biomes is a key component of TFC. Also, having the 5 critical biomes is rather less useful if all of them are under the ocean. So if a candidate meets the first test, I then check the biomes.png file. This is a layout of the actual biomes in TFC. Actual biomes in TFC are rather useless except that it differentiates between land biomes and ocean biomes. I look for largish landmasses with a good ocean connecting them together. Ocean travel is a much faster and safer way to quickly get to all the various rock biomes.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>For a server, I might go so far as to examine the rock_top.png file and ensure that no critical rock biome is under the ocean. I've even gone so far as to overlay that rock_top.png on the biomes.png in photoshop to get a clear idea of where the land is and where the rocks are.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>How much effort you want to expend on that is up to you. For SSP, having a single Pangea landmass can be convenient if you like. Again I cull out the folders that TFCSeedmaker produces and leave the possible candidates. Then a second pass examining the actual layout of the land. If I'm not entirely satisfied I may run TFCSeedmaker again, generating another 10 candidates for examination. This process continues until I have 3 or 4 candidates that I believe are suitable.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Only now do we fire up our TFC client and actually look at the seeds. This is even more a matter of personal preference. If I know that a seed has the rocks I need, then depending on how particular I'm feeling, I may go further. I may look for nice plains to build on. Good sources of hot water, lava, salt water and fresh water. Pretty mountains. Tree types. I may start all the various seeds with cheats on, enable creative mode and fly about, checking the seed from an esthetic angle. This part is up to you. If I'm selecting for a server I may spend some time on this. If it's for my own SSP play, then I won't do this at all and let the actual layout of terrain be a surprise.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p italics="true">Summary -</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>In the end, selecting a decent seed in TFC is much more important than in vanilla Minecraft. It can be extremely frustrating to be unable to find a critical resource needed to progress. Keep in mind however, that in theory every rock type will eventually spawn, given a large enough world. So if you're really hardcore you can just pick whatever spawn comes up and overcome whatever obstables the RNGejus generates for you and persevere. But if you are just starting out, starting a server for you and others to play on, or just want to know that everything you need will be 'somewhere' nearby. Then I recommend spending some time on finding a decent seed. TFC is hard enough without being able to find flux within 18000 blocks of your spawn.</p>
      <p space="10"/>
      <p>Hope this helps and look forward to your feedback.</p>

      <p>- TFC</p>
      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.37 - Can we have Hwyla back please?</p>
      <p>Very minor little update. Apparently the dependency isn't there anymore, so we can return to using Hwyla. This should work much better with everything. Also updated the ChiselNBits recipes/config to allow for TFC log/dirt/gravel chiseling. TerraFirmaThings gem displays now emit redstone signal. See the mods page for details. Also updated the Faithful TFC Resource Pack.</p>

      <p>- updates for Terrafirmathings, NuclearCraft, CraftTweaker</p>
      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.29 - No Free Lunch</p>
      <p>Update to the Leather Forging Tunic. It now comes with a debuff while worn. You will be immune from the forge heat but you always won't be able to move, and your focus will be squarely on your forge and anvil. Also changed the Leather Tunic recipe. Now is made from a Leather Chestplate soaked in Limewater for 8 hours.</p>
      <p>Added a small ore to normal hammer recipe. Now those small ore nuggets can be turned into a normal one at a 5 to 1 rate. Good for those non-meltable ores.</p>
      <p>- Fixed the BwM wicker recipe to use TFC reeds. This allows the creation of BwM elevators.</p>
      <p>- Fixed a minor recipe for Engineers Decor stained blocks to use all the TFC dirt instead of vanilla.</p>
      <p>- Turned the TFC-Ambiental temp display permanently on. Due to the implementation if you want to revert to the default, hold shift to display, behaviour you will have to edit the config/tfcambiental.cfg and set sneakyDetails=true</p>
      <p>- Updated ImmersiveTech</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.28.1 - Hotfix 1</p>
      <p>Update for TFC-Storage - Fixed TOP display on dedicated servers</p>
      <p>Also added the ability to feed apples to horses. Not being able to give a horse an apple is a sacrilege.</p>
      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.28 - Creature Comforts</p>
      <p>Lots of little changes to maybe make life a tiny bit more survivable. </p>
      <p>1. Enhancements to the body temperature (TFCAmbiental) mod. A number of changes have been made:</p>
      <p> - Different armour provides different levels of protection. Amazingly, Black Bronze now provides protection from the sun, not the cold! Must be the gold/silver conducting heat to the soil. Yeah, that's it. This protection is also extended to Red Steel armour. All other vanilla TFC armours provide increasing levels of protection from the cold. The TFC Metallum armours only provide the standard protection.</p>
      <p>- A Leather Tunic has been added that when equipped in the Baubles (yes, that's new) chest slot, will protect the wearer from the searing temperatures while working the forge. It provides no other protection.</p>
      <p>- Straw can be used to provide limited cold protection while in inventory. The protection is based on how many slots in inventory are occupied by straw, not the amount in the stack. So spreading out your straw to take all slots will provide quite a bit of cold protection, at the exchange of inventory slots. The exact amount probably needs tweaking, so I look forward to your feedback.</p>
      <p>- Similarly, ice blocks can be used in the same fashion to provide cooling. Ice blocks can be obtained by breaking ice blocks with a saw. Same mechanism as straw, each slot occupied by an ice block will provide cooling. Feedback needed.</p>
      <p>- The Steel Furnace will provide heat while it's burning</p>
      <p>- The IE External Heater, while running and connected to a Steel Furnace will provide significant heat. A lever can be used to enable the heater/furnace even without items in the furnace to process. Looking to add a redstone enabled thermometer which should allow redstone mechanisms to automatically provide a set amount of heat.</p>
      <p>- The IE Electric lanterns provide a small amount of heat when powered. Again, feedback on amount needed.</p>
      <p>2. TFCStorage. Lumintorious has been at it again and brought us another nifty mod, TFCStorage! This provides a number of storage options to increase the lifetime of stored foods. Includes meat hooks, storage jars, storage shelves, grain piles and new mechanisms to combat food decay. Feedback appreciated. The One Probe data on the stored foods is currently broken on dedicated servers, but hopefully will be fixed soon. See the CurseForge page for the TFC-Storage mod for exact details.</p>
      <p>3. The One Probe - We've switched from Hywla to the One Probe. It's been configured to look like Hywla so not a lot should be changed. Reason for the switch is a current hard-coded dependency for TFC-Storage. Makes little difference to me.</p>
      <p>4. Snow shoes may? be fixed.</p>
      <p>5. Fixed the broken trap door and Nickel Silver armour textures. Now you have no reason not to have a Manganese trapdoor. Textures by me, so they are not pretty</p>
      <p>6. The previous changes to allow some of the TFC-Metallum metals to be melted in the forge/induction crucible given sufficient temperature has been reverted. A number of issues arose and for now, was easier to just revert to previous behaviour. A wholesale rework of the metals/alloys/temperatures/armour and tool strengths will be looked at in upcoming versions. I am also going to provide a mechanism to convert the surface nuggets of these metals to scrap for Arc Furnace processing.</p>
      <p>7. Small reduction in the plank output from the BwM Saw and Horsepower Saw. Not quite the doubling of output as previous.</p>
      <p>8. Dynmap render data for dedicated servers has been updated to fix the rendering of TFC Fresh/Salt/Hot water.</p>
      <p>9. Fixed some of the Tin Plate hijinks. The Tin  Plate should now be Metal Pressable and meltable. </p>
      <p>10. The AR Precision Assembler recipes have been altered to utilize Ore Dictionary entries wherever possible.</p>
      <p>11. The NC Light Rad Shielding recipe has been fixed. Eventually want to add the Rad shielding to the Ambiental setup. Will see this in upcoming versions.</p>
      <p>12. Maybe finally fixed the Stone Age boat recipe to actually use all 3 logs it specifies in the recipe.</p>
      <p>13. Nuclearcraft updated.</p>
      <p>As always, I look forward to your feedback and issues. Likely will be a follow-on release fairly soon with an update for some known issues, particularly with TFC-Storage.</p>
      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.27 - Plate it up</p>
      <p>- Went through and fixed all the ingot>plate>sheet recipes. Allow plates to be melted. Should hopefully close any dupe loops in plate processing.</p>

      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.24 - Break the unbroken things</p>
      <p>NOTE: This Version is a world-breaker!!!!! Do not use this with existing worlds. Due to extensive changes to worldgen, you need a new world. Cannot emphasize this enough!</p>
      <p>This Version brings nuclearcraft and all the bits to go with it. Lots of new ores, lots of new machines, lots of new bugs. We also see the return of Steve's Workshop, now called Engineers Workshop. Nice little crafting table mod.</p>
      <p>AdvancedTFCTech is finally ready to go. This brings an IE Like Auto Loom that is very cool.</p>
      <p>Added a number of small performance mods that may enhance the experience. Or they may bring new bugs. I look forward to your feedback.</p>
      <p>Mod updates:</p>
      <p>  - TFC - Adds a pile of new animals and seasonal colours.</p>
      <p>  - TNFCMod - Adds a number of new ores to bring nuclearcraft to life. Also the mod has been renamed to fix an issue with overwriting bits of the TFC Patchouli book.</p>
      <p>Adds ores/metals:</p>
      <p>FERROBORON</p>
      <p>THORIUM</p>
      <p>LITHIUM</p>
      <p>MANGANESE</p>

      <p>TOUGH</p>
      <p>URANIUM</p>
      <p>Removes:</p>
      <p>BORON and uses Borax from TFC Itself</p>
      <p>  - SimplyJetpacks</p>
      <p> - Immersive Technology</p>
      <p>  - JEI</p>
      <p>  - Crafttweaker</p>
      <p>New mods:</p>

      <p>TFCSeasonal - Folded into base TFC mod.</p>
      <p>Again, I apologize for the world-breaking nature of this update. If you're curious, the issue is that using this update with existing worlds breaks the metal melting configuration. Nothing will melt in a crucible from an existing world. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!</p>
      <p>Otherwise, look forward to your feedback. Given the amount of stuff that nuclearcraft adds, I fully expect a large amount of bugs and likely a number of hotfixes to come out.</p>
      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.23 - Fix the broken things</p>
      <p>- Crop regen will check if a crop is wild before removing.</p>
      <p>- Add some missing dusts for metals</p>

      <p>- Fix all the PneumaticCraft upgrade recipes</p>

      <p>-Updated:</p>
      <p>    - TFC Ambiental</p>

      <p>    - SimplyJetpacks</p>
      <p>    - Controlling</p>
      <p>    - BiomeTweaker</p>
      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.22 - Few little things</p>
      <p>- Fix BwM Saw recipes to return lumber rather than planks.</p>
      <p>- Actually implement crop/stick/rock regen. Will regen in the spring/early summer months. Odds of crops regen are 5x the TFC Config regen value. (So 1 in 250 by default). Rocks and sticks and ore nuggets will all regen. If this is laggy or breaking, changing the D:sticksRocksModifier=0.4 to 0 will disable ALL chunk regeneration.</p>
      <p>- Fix the Arc Furnace recipe adding. Stop removing recipes!</p>
      <p>- Added TFCAmbiental - Brings body temperature to TFC. Set the configs fairly forgiving so it should be not too bad. We'll see</p>
      <p>- Updated TFCTech - No more stacking weirdness and easy duping of wires.</p>
      <p>- Updated TFC. Little bug fixes.</p>

      <p>- Fix End City loot</p>
      <p>- New icons for items</p>

      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.20.3 Beta - Minor tweaks.</p>
      <p>- With all the fun with the missing ores, was time to do something to clean it up. All of the non-surface clue generating ores will now generate a clue. The clue will be a surface rock that does not match the surrounding rock biome. Watch for this!</p>
      <p>- Made another set of adjustments to the IE Excavator. Removed some of the silts and adjusted the setup for some of the newer mineral sets added.</p>
      <p>- Also the rules around metal blocks have been adjusted. They now take two double sheets to make on the anvil. Or 8 ingots on the metal press. This results in 800 units when the block is melted. And also 8 dusts when crushed. </p>
      <p>- Any blocks that do not melt, will continue to require 9 ingots to create and should result in 9 ingots on breaking up.</p>
      <p>- The Oregen for other biomes has also been adjusted to add the new ores.</p>
      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.20.2 Beta - The Hotfix Edition part 2. </p>
      <p>MCTImmersiveTechnologies update was yanked and then updated. So we update too.</p>
      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.20.1 Beta - The Hotfix Edition</p>
      <p>Maybe generate some Rutile for some titanium? Okay then. Also maybe the excavator could find some too? Good idea!</p>
      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.20 Beta - The OMGWTFBBQ Update</p>
      <p>You may/will get warnings upon loading an existing world with the inclusion of BiomeTweakerCore. I've not found any issues with loading anyway, as none of the changes affect TFC worlds. But take a backup first anyway. You've been warned.</p>
      <p>There are lots of little tweaks/fixes/etc in this version. Please look at the commit history for the pack and the mod on Github.</p>
      <p>The resource pack was updated. So if you had it setup before, you'll need to go and re-add it. The defaultoptions will select it upon a new install.</p>
      <p>- Added Advanced Rocketry</p>
      <p>  - Lot of stuff went into adding this one. Lots of config and recipe changes. Please let me know about issues, I know there will be lots. Discord is best place to do that.</p>

      <p>   - Configurable support beam range. No change in TNFC but go nuts if you suck at TFC mining.</p>
      <p>    - Other little bits.</p>

      <p>- Made Waystones actually craftable again.  Through the use of, you guessed it, gemmed redstone latches.</p>
      <p>- Bunch of recipes for Rockhounding Chemistry. All the basic functions should now be sorted for the mod. The basic TFC alloys are also craftable within the mod. Now just need to work on ore doubling/tripling. Soon:  Geminus fluid!</p>

      <p>JEI</p>
      <p>Added:</p>
      <p>Debarked mod - Thx Therighthon</p>
      <p>   This mod let's you remove the bark from logs. Either by shift-right clicking a log in the world with an axe, or as a crafting recipe with the log(s) and an axe. Debarked logs are purely for decorative purposes.</p>

      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.6Beta- Little things</p>
      <p>Small changes. Been actually playing through so  had a chance to see a few things and make some changes. The 'big' one is the availability of the wooden fishing pole earlier than iron through the introduction of the copper fishhook. Some other minor changes based on things I'd noticed during my playthrough. Also removed the TFC Debug block from a recipe. Likely nobody noticed but it was in there for testing and forgot to remove it.  Also added a new mod from ClayCorp to manage the TFC Size and Weight in use with modded inventories </p>
      <p bold="true">Version 12.2.5- Beta - Let's Start Some More</p>
      <p>Now with some actual tech mods and 'some' of their progression. More of the Rockhounding stuff is configured.</p>
      <p>Updated ImmersiveTech to ImmersiveTechnology. Thanks for the headsup from Grigoriewich. Now we have working distillers and boilers for stuff.</p>
